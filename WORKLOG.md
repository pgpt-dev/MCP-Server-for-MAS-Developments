# PrivateGPT MCP Server Development Log

## ⚠️ Warning: User Management Implementation

**HANDLE WITH CARE**: The user management endpoints have significant impact and can potentially delete all users if not handled properly. While the API functionality has been tested successfully, implementation in the pgpt-mcp-server is pending due to these security considerations.

The following user management endpoints require careful implementation:

### Create User (POST /api/v1/users)
Required functionality:
- Create new user with name, email, and password
- Set optional language and timezone
- Configure public access and group assignments
- Assign user roles
- Set up FTP access if needed
- Handle all required fields:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "User Name",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "UserPassword123",
    "language": "en",
    "timezone": "UTC",
    "usePublic": true,
    "groups": ["Group A"],
    "roles": ["Sources"],
    "activateFtp": true,
    "ftpPassword": "FTPPassword!"
  }
  ```

### Edit User (PATCH /api/v1/users)
Required functionality:
- Update user details by email
- Modify name, language, and group assignments
- Handle partial updates
- Fields that can be updated:
  ```json
  {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "name": "Updated Name",
    "language": "en",
    "groups": ["Updated Group"]
  }
  ```

### Delete User (DELETE /api/v1/users)
⚠️ **Critical Operation**
Required functionality:
- Remove user by email
- Clean up associated data
- Handle dependencies:
  ```json
  {
    "email": "user@example.com"
  }
  ```

## Implementation Status

### Core Server Structure
- ✅ Basic MCP server setup with stdio transport
- ✅ Error handling and graceful shutdown
- ✅ Type-safe request handling
- ✅ Input validation for all tools

### API Integration
- ✅ Authentication with Bearer tokens
- ✅ Automatic token refresh
- ✅ Error mapping to MCP error codes
- ✅ JSON response formatting

### Tools Implementation
1. Chat Tool
   - ✅ Chat creation with knowledge base selection
   - ✅ Support for public and document knowledge bases
   - ✅ Group-based access control
   - ✅ Language support
   - ✅ Chat continuation support

2. Source Management
   - ✅ Source creation with markdown formatting
   - ✅ Group assignment for private sources
   - ✅ Source listing by group
   - ✅ Source details retrieval
   - ✅ Source deletion
   - ✅ Source editing

3. Group Management
   - ✅ List personal and assignable groups
   - ✅ Group-based visibility control
   - ✅ Personal group handling
   - ✅ Group creation
   - ✅ Group deletion

## API Behavior Notes

### Authentication
- Uses Bearer token authentication via `/api/v1/login`
- Token required for all authenticated endpoints
- Token invalidation via `/api/v1/logout`

### Group Management
- GET `/api/v1/groups` returns personalGroups and assignableGroups arrays
- Personal group appears in both arrays
- Groups control access to sources and knowledge base
- Full CRUD operations implemented and tested

### Source Management
- Sources can be public or private
- Private sources require group assignment
- Sources are vectorized asynchronously
- Source states: creation → vectorized
- Source operations:
  - POST `/api/v1/sources` for creation
  - DELETE `/api/v1/sources/{sourceId}` for removal
  - PATCH `/api/v1/sources/{sourceId}` for editing
  - Can list sources by group
  - Can verify source state and visibility
- All operations tested and verified

### Chat System
- Two knowledge base types:
  - Public (usePublic: true)
  - Document (specific groups)
- Chat operations:
  - Initial creation: POST `/api/v1/chats`
  - Continuation: PATCH `/api/v1/chats/{chatId}`
  - Details: GET `/api/v1/chats/{chatId}`
- Chat features:
  - Preserves complete message history
  - Context-aware responses
  - Group-based access control
  - Language support

## Implementation Details

### Type Safety
- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all API interactions
- Runtime validation for all tool inputs
- Error type mapping between API and MCP

### Error Handling
- API errors mapped to appropriate MCP error codes
- Detailed error messages preserved
- Authentication errors handled gracefully

### Resource Management
- No direct resource exposure currently
- All data access through tools
- Future potential for direct resource access

## Future Improvements
1. Performance Optimizations:
   - Add caching layer
   - Optimize API requests
   - Improve response times

2. Monitoring and Observability:
   - Add comprehensive logging
   - Add metrics collection
   - Add performance tracking

3. Documentation:
   - Add API reference documentation
   - Add deployment guides
   - Add troubleshooting guides

4. Security Enhancements:
   - Add rate limiting
   - Implement request validation
   - Add security headers
   - Enhance token management
   - Add user session management

## Testing Notes
- ✅ All major API endpoints tested
- ✅ Group-based access control verified
- ✅ Chat system behavior documented
- ✅ Source visibility rules confirmed
- ✅ Error handling validated
- ✅ Source CRUD operations verified
- ✅ Group CRUD operations verified
- ✅ User management API functionality tested
